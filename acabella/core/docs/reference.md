`ACABELLA` provides different functions and classes for analyzing
the security of ABE schemes.

## Classes for finding attacks in ABE schemes

The base class for finding attacks is the
`Attack` class:

::: attack

### Master key attacks

::: master_key

### Decryption key attacks

::: decryption

::: parse_config

## Methods for generating indexed encodings and specific access structures

::: access_structures

## Methods for working with Sympy symbols

::: doc_common

## Methods for generating general encodings

::: encodings_helper

## Methods for translating the ACABELLA format to ABGW inputs

::: generate_abgw_inputs

## Methods for proof generation

::: proof_generation

## Methods for proof verification
