# Analyzing the security of ABE schemes using ACABELLA

In this part of the documentation, we show how to analyze the
security of ABE schemes using the `SecurityAttack` class and also, using
the acabella command line tool.

The `SecurityAttack` class (and the `Analysis` class, when using the security analysis part) performs the following checks:

- It validates whether the scheme satisfies the AC17 form or not.
- It checks if the scheme is trivially and collusion secure.
- For secure schemes, it finds a proof for the symbolic property (in the AC17 framework).
- It validates whether the ABE scheme sastisfies the FABEO property or not.

Using the analysis report, the practitioner can look further into the possiblity of attacking the scheme via master key attacks and decryption attacks, as we explain in the next sections.

## Example: analyzing a secure scheme

We'll analyze the security of the RW13 ABE scheme using the SecurityAttack class.
First, we need to declare the encodings of the scheme as Sympy symbols and create lists of encodings for each type, e.g., key encodings, ciphertext encodings, MPK encodings, etc. We also need to identify the unknown variables of the scheme:

```python
    alpha, b, bp, b0, b1, r, rp, rp2, x, y, z, s, sp, sp2, v2 = symbols('alpha, b, bp, b0, b1, r, rp, rp2, x, y, z, s, sp, sp2, v2')

    k1 = alpha + r*b
    k2 = r*bp + rp*(b0 + y*b1)
    k3 = r
    k4 = rp
    k5 = r*bp + rp2*(b0 + z*b1)
    k6 = rp2
    c1 = (s-v2)*b + sp*bp
    c2 = sp*(b0 + x*b1)
    c3 = s
    c4 = sp
    c5 = v2*b + sp2*bp
    c6 = sp2*(b0 + z*b1)
    c7 = sp2
    mpk1 = b0
    mpk2 = b1
    mpk3 = b
    mpk4 = bp
    
    # known values: x, y

    unknown = [alpha, b, b0, b1, bp, r, rp, rp2, s, sp, sp2, v2]

    k = [k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6]
    c = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7]
    mpk = [mpk1, mpk2, mpk3, mpk4]
```

Then, we create a SecurityAttack() element and initialize it with the description of alpha, s, the blinding factor and the encodings. The fourth parameter is related to the type of scheme we are dealing with, and if this scheme is fractional or not:

```python
    security_attack = SecurityAttack()
    security_attack.init(alpha*s, k, c, mpk, unknown)
    security_attack.run()
    print("\n[*] Security analysis results:\n")
    print("\n" + security_attack.show_solution())
    security_attack.show_proof()
```

It produces the following analysis report:

```bash

[*] Security analysis results:


See the analysis report below. If the scheme is MA-ABE you might try to run this check with corruption.


 The pair encoding scheme satisfies the AC17 form. The ciphertext encoding previously contained non-lone variables that act as lone variables. These have now been replaced by lone variables.


 Performing security analysis on the following encodings:

                MPK encodings:                  [b0, b1, b, bp]

                Ciphertext encodings:   [b*s + bp*sp - v2, b0*sp + b1*sp*x, s, sp, bp*sp2 + v2, b0*sp2 + b1*sp2*z, sp2]


 == Performing simple trivial security check.. ==

         Passed! The security of the scheme depends on whether at least one of the following assumption(s) holds:

                 (1) x - z != 0

         The scheme satisfies our collusion property and is thus secure against collusion.

                        [0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -x/(x - y), 1/(x - y), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -x/(x - z), 1/(x - z), 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

                 The vector with 1 in the entry corresponding to alpha*sp2 and 0 in the entries corresponding to alpha*s,alpha*sp is: 
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1]

## Example: analyzing an insecure scheme

In this example, we'll analyze an insecure scheme, namely the NDCW15 scheme, which can be attacked via a decryption attack (which we show in the next section).

First, we'll prepare a JSON file including the definition of the scheme, that is, the description of alpha, s, the blinding factor and the respective encodings and unknown variables:

```json
{
    "scheme_id": "ndcw15",
    "analysis": "security",
    "k": ["alpha * (1 / (b1 + x3)) + x2 * b2 * (1 / (b1 + x3))", "x1", "x1 * b1"],
    "c": ["s", "s * b1", "s * b2"],
    "mpk": [],
    "key" : "alpha * s",
    "unknown_vars" :  ["alpha", "b1", "b2", "s"],
    "corruptable_vars": []
}
```

We then can run ACABELLA and obtain the following analysis report, which finds that the scheme is trivially broken:

**Note**
> The respective JSON files, and others, for the NDCW15 scheme are included in the current ACABELLA distribution.

```python
$ python acabella_cmd.py -a sec -c examples/ndcw15/ndcw15_analysis_config.json
