abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) enables fine-grained access control on encrypted data and has a large number of practical applications. This paper presents FABEO: faster pairing-based ciphertext-policy and key-policy ABE schemes that support expressive policies and put no restriction on policy type or attributes, and the first to achieve optimal, adaptive security with multiple challenge ciphertexts. We implement our schemes and demonstrate that they perform better than the state-of-the-art (Bethencourt et al. S&P 2007, Agrawal et al., CCS 2017 and Ambrona et al., CCS 2017) on all parameters of practical interest.},

abstract = {Personal health records (PHR) are an emerging health information exchange model, which facilitates PHR owners to efficiently manage their health data. Typically, PHRs are outsourced and stored in third-party cloud platforms. Although, outsourcing private health data to third-party platforms is an appealing solution for PHR owners, it may lead to significant privacy concerns, because there is a higher risk of leaking private data to unauthorized parties. As a way of ensuring PHR owners' control of their outsourced PHR data, attribute based encryption (ABE) mechanisms have been considered due to the fact that such schemes facilitate a mechanism of sharing encrypted data among a set of intended recipients. However, such existing PHR solutions suffer from inflexibility and scalability issues due to the limitations associated with the adopted ABE mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose a distributed multi-authority ABE scheme and thereby we show how a patient-centric, attribute based PHR sharing scheme which can provide flexible access for both professional users such as doctors as well as personal users such as family and friends is realized. We have shown that the proposed scheme supports on-demand user revocation as well as secure under standard security assumptions. In addition, the simulation results provide evidence for the fact that our scheme can function efficiently in practice. Furthermore, we have shown that the proposed scheme can cater the access requirements associated with distributed multiuser PHR sharing environments as well as more realistic and scalable compared with similar existing PHR sharing schemes.},

    abstract="In this paper, we introduce a new multi-authority ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (MA-CP-ABE) system. In our system, there are multiple central authorities (CAs) and attribute authorities (AAs). The CAs will not need to coordinate or even be aware of each other, and so do the AAs. In particular, we present two constructions that will be proved secure in the standard model. Our first scheme is fully secure under static assumptions in composite-order bilinear group, and can work for any monotone access structure. The second one achieves constant size ciphertexts for AND-gate policy in prime-order group. The security can be proved under the decisional linear (DLIN) assumption.",

abstract="To make multi-authority ABE schemes collusion-resistant, a user in the system must be tied with a globally verifiable identifier GID. The drawback of this approach is that it compromises the user's privacy. Malicious authorities can collect user's attributes by tracing the user GID, thus compromises the privacy of the user. The other privacy concern is access structures that sent along with ciphertext in traditional CP-ABE schemes may have sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a multi-authority ABE scheme with fully hidden access structure that authorities can get nothing about user GID when generating and issuing user private keys and access structures are hidden to receivers. We prove the security of our scheme under a standard complexity assumption of decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. The access structure we used in our scheme is AND, OR gates on multi-valued attributes.",
